//because add is the sum of some previous elements in the vector, add < 0 means adding the sum of previous elements will make the whole sum less, 
//that's why assigning 0 to add which gets rid of the previous elements and count the sum from the current element.
//also initial value of res can't be 0 in case alll the elements are less than 0.
