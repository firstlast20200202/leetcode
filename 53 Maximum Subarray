            res = max(res, add);    //step 1

//because add is the sum of some previous elements in the vector, add < 0 means adding the sum of previous elements will make the whole sum less, 
//that's why assigning 0 to add which gets rid of the previous elements and count the sum from the current element.
//also initial value of res can't be 0 in case all the elements are less than 0.

//step 1 and step 2 cant be exchanged order, in case all the element are less than 0, say, [-2,-1,-3,-1,-1], then res should be always less than 0, but in this case 0 would be assigned to res
